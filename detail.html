It contains HTML- and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.<u>"Bootstrap is the second most-starred project on GitHub, with more than 111,600 stars and 51,500 forks</u>. it is developed and maintained by <a href="https://github.com/fat"> Jacob Thronton</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/fat"> @fat </a>) and <a href="https://github.com/mdo"> Mark Otto </a>(<a href="https://twitter.com/mdo"> @mdo </a>), well the main and best advantage of bootstrap is it's customisation of webpage with width of front-end device for better uderstanding we will see it with general example given below:</p>
	<p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">well imagine you are a well known web developer you are master init and when you develope a site you just develope it according to the your machine like computer which usually have screen size of 13 to 18 inches, but how your website gonna behave on small screen size devices like mobile, tablets. if you are familier to that problem then you will realize website is overspanned on mobile screen and you have resize it by zooming in or zooming out to see the content properly which is so annoying for menus like navigation or form submission.<br>then bootstrap is best solution for this problem which customises width of website with the width of front-end device using it's greed system.</p><p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">undoubtedly best advantage of using bootstrap is it's speed of development, bootstrap comes with it's built in css styles, javascipts and jquery functionality which saves alot time in developing any site from scratch. just use predefined classes, id's and you will see a stunning, stylish, responsive website in no time. </p><p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">as we can see mobile is main stream of today's world, day by day mobile communication is growing at greate extent, mobile is main concern for every person in normal life. Creating mobile ready websites is a breeze with Bootstrap thanks to the fluid grid layout that dynamically adjusts to the proper screen resolution. There is virtually no work that needs to be done to achieve proper responsiveness. Using Bootstrapâ€™s ready made classes, you can specify how many spots in the grid system you want each column to occupy. Then, you can specify at which point you want your columns to stack horizontally rather than vertically to display properly on mobile devices.</p>

	<h3>What is CDN ?</h3>
	<p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">CDN is short for <strong>C</strong>ontent <strong>D</strong>elivery <strong>N</strong>etwork
	<p style="font-size: 18px;text-align: justify;">A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver pages and other Web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery server.
	This service is effective in speeding the delivery of content of websites with high traffic and websites that have global reach. The closer the CDN server is to the user geographically, the faster the content will be delivered to the user. CDNs also provide protection from large surges in traffic.</p>
